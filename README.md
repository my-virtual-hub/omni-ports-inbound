# Omni Ports Inbound

This module, "omni-ports-inbound," is focused on the effective management of inbound interfaces and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). These interfaces are crucial for data entry into the system, establishing a clear contract for communication and processing information from external sources or other layers of the project.

The inclusion of DTOs in this module facilitates the transfer of data between the application and model layers. They are essential to ensure that only relevant data is transferred, promoting efficiency and minimizing coupling between layers. This approach simplifies interactions between different parts of the system, contributing to more effective maintenance and scalability.

Moreover, "omni-ports-inbound" aids in standardizing how data is received and processed within the system. This ensures greater cohesion and consistency throughout the project, easing management and code evolution.

In essence, the "omni-ports-inbound" module is an integral part of the Omni project, providing a clear and efficient structure for the management of inbound data. It allows developers to focus on more specific aspects of development while data communication is handled reliably and structured.
